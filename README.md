# `parrotlink_icp`

Welcome to the parrotlink_icp project: a cutting-edge connection layer leveraging the power of the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)
to facilitate a seamless transfer of arguments from front-end interfaces to back-end services.

Our mission is to provide developers with a robust and secure way to interact with blockchain technologies and enable applications
to perform complex operations with ease.

## Overview

The core of the `parrotlink_icp` project is the one method, designed to bridge user inputs from a front-end application and translate them into executable calls on the backend through the Internet Computer blockchain. This method ensures that the interaction with smart contracts is both straightforward and efficient.

## Configuration
Make sure to configure the ICP canisters and method according to your specific use case.

## Getting Started

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
cd parrotlink_icp/
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

If you want to deploy project on the mainnet, you can use the following commands:
```bash
cd parrotlink_icp/

dfx deploy --network ic
```
